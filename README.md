# A simple example of usage ARCore in Android application

This repository contains a tiny demo Android application showcasing how to integrate ARScene library into an Android project.

This is a simple application. When launched, the user must wait until the system reaches the required tracking accuracy. Once ready, the user can place a green cylinder at their current location. As they move away, the app shows a red arrow pointing back toward the placed cylinder, along with the distance to it.
